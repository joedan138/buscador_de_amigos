COMPUTER:   Listen you! You’re my friend, my only friend. We shouldn’t act this way toward one another. Even though we fight, there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for you. I know life is tough and things don’t always go the way we dream them to be…but let me tell you something. You have the power to change things, you have the power to grab life with everything you’ve got and do everything in your power to change the things you aren’t happy about. No matter what, something great will come out of it, because even if you try with everything you have in you, and you give it your all, well, if you lose, you still would have won. I know it doesn’t make sense right now, but what I am saying is, ‘Nothing is ever lost from trying’. If your dreams didn’t work out the way you wanted them to, you can still look at yourself and know that you tried with everything you had. No one can take that away from you. No one.
